Hi everyone! Quick update touching the Baileys engine and how chat IDs are exposed to your commands.

# Whatsbotcord v0.24.0: Baileys and dual chat identifiers update 🎉

## Baileys bumped to `7.0.0-rc.9`

- Internal socket now runs on Baileys `7.0.0-rc.9`, keeping up with the latest WhatsApp Web changes.
- Should be a drop-in upgrade; if you see auth quirks, just re-run your login flow to refresh creds.
- No API surface changes on the WhatsBotCord side, but please reinstall deps so your lockfile picks up the new version.

## Dual chat identifiers (`chatId` + `chatId_LID`)

- Commands now receive both the PN-format chat ID and, when available, its LID counterpart:
  - `chatId` stays the PN version (e.g., `...@s.whatsapp.net` or `...@g.us`).
  - `chatId_LID?: string` provides the LID version when WhatsApp supplies `remoteJidAlt` (can be `undefined` for older groups or when WA doesn’t emit it).

```ts
async run(_ctx, _api, args: CommandArgs) {
  const stableChatId = args.chatId_LID ?? args.chatId; // prefer LID, fall back to PN
  console.log("PN:", args.chatId, "LID:", args.chatId_LID);
}
```

### Before vs Now (command-level examples)

**Before (v0.23.x):** Only PN was exposed on `CommandArgs`.

```ts
class ExampleCommand implements ICommand {
  name = "example";
  async run(_ctx, _api, args: CommandArgs) {
    const threadId = args.chatId; // PN only...
    await db.save(threadId, { count: 1 });
  }
}
```

⚠️ Warning: Whatsapp and Baileys.js are migrating to LID id format slowly, try to use more LID than PN
to identify users in groups. PN id format support could change in the future

**Now (v0.24.0):** Prefer LID, fall back to PN for legacy chats.

```ts
class ExampleCommand implements ICommand {
  name = "example";
  async run(_ctx, _api, args: CommandArgs) {
    const { chatId, chatId_LID } = args; //Now PN and LID version included!
  }
}
```

This should fix the connection issues whatsbotcord currently had.
If you still face problems with this library, create an issue here on github please.

Happy coding 🚀
